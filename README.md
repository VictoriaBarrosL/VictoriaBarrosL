### Hi there! :blush:

I'm Victoria, a currently a student of Software Analysis and Development and I am professionaling myself with several immersive courses that address technologies and project development in C#.

The programming universe has become a passion and knowing more about it every day is incredible, so I look for opportunities where I can exercise and improve my knowledge acquired so far.
